* **Standups**: the team meets daily for short meetings which are typically held standing up, face-to-face to encourage brief sessions.  This is not a status meeting.  Status should be visible in the issue tracker, trello board or other collaboration tools.  This meeting is for people to ask quick questions that will allow them to get information or remove blockers.  Long answers and discussions should have follow-up in smaller groups after the standup meeting.
* **Retrospectives**: on a regular basis, at end of each sprint, weekly or bi-weekly, a retrospective allows for the team to reflect and adjust practices.  Any team member can voice a problem or propose a solution
* **Sprints** are the heartbeat of the agile process. Small units of work are delivered in short bursts, typically with 1 or 2 week cycles.  We aim for visible progress for people from the target audience that is delivered and validated at the end of each cycle, allowing the team to move iteratively toward the goal, with regular opportunity for course correction.
* **Sprint planning**: include the whole team in reviewing stories, breaking down use cases into small user-facing stories
