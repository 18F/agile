# Agile Principles and Practice

This work is based on interviews of 18F project teams, as well as individuals inside and outside of government with experience in the agile disciplines of XP, Scrum, Lean Startup, Lean UX, as well as the relevant design disciplines of Human Centered Design and Design Thinking.

We believe that Agile implies Human Centered Design and works best when cross-discliplinary teams work together throughout the development cycle, therefore, such teams are the focus of this guide.

This should be considered a work in progress.  We welcome pull requests and discussion via [github issues](https://github.com/18F/agile/issues).
