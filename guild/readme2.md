# Agile Guild

The Technology Transformation Service (TTS) Agile guild is a community that fosters agile methodologies within government so that our work will deliver more value to its users.

## Why we are here

### History

Originally focused on 18F issues, guilds began in 2015 as a forum where team members can come together based on discipline areas. For more information on guilds and working groups, see the [TTS Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/working-groups-and-guilds-101/).  


### Purpose and priorities

An open and voluntary group like our guild can help foster a committee of professionals in a specific subject area. Benefits include:
 - Improve overall productivity through sharing of knowledge 
 - Spread Agile practices throughout our organization
 - Bring together different parts of organization with different methodologies, varying experience, and varying understanding of methodologies
 - Have a single, specific resource to turn to
 - Give more seasoned staff opportunities to share their expertise with less experienced staff
 - Give less experienced staff opportunities to become better in their roles in an environments away from their chapters and engagements 
 - Create energy and have fun!
(Find ways for these folks to contribute and be involved)

# Agile Principles and Practice

This work is based on interviews of 18F project teams, as well as individuals inside and outside of government with experience in the agile disciplines of XP, Scrum, Lean Startup, Lean UX, as well as the relevant design disciplines of Human Centered Design and Design Thinking.

We believe that Agile implies Human Centered Design and works best when cross-discliplinary teams work together throughout the development cycle, therefore, such teams are the focus of this guide.

This should be considered a work in progress.  We welcome pull requests and discussion via [github issues](https://github.com/18F/agile/issues).
